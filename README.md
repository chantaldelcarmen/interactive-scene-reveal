## About

*Common Ground* is an interactive narrative experience that explores how four travelers see the same world through different lenses. Each person's unique perspective — represented through colour — reveals something essential about the scene. Together, their combined views create a complete picture that none could see alone.

## How to Experience

### Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Click **"Begin"** to start the journey
3. Watch the narrative unfold through three introductory scenes

### Interactive Scene (Scene 4)
Once you reach the interactive scene:
- **Click each character's button** to reveal their unique perspective:
  - **Umer** (brown) — sees warmth, connection, and meaning
  - **Anna** (yellow) — brings energy and uplifting light
  - **Chantal** (sky blue) — values openness and space
  - **Lei** (green) — focuses on growth and progress
- Read each description that appears to understand their lens
- When all four buttons are pressed, a magical shimmer animation plays
- The full-colour scene reveals after 6 seconds, followed by a zoom and final reveal text

### Controls
Located in the top-right corner:
- **🔊 Mute/Unmute** — Toggle audio on/off
- **⏸️ Pause/Play** — Pause or resume the experience
- **🔄 Replay** — Restart from the beginning
